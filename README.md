This repository contains the main JavaScript file for a backend service developed using Node.js and Express framework. It establishes an HTTP server configured to listen on port 3000. The service includes comprehensive routes designed to manage tasks, encompassing creating new tasks, retrieving existing tasks, updating, and deleting them. Task data is temporarily stored in an in-memory array, allowing for efficient data manipulation without persistent storage. This setup demonstrates the foundational operations of a CRUD application, suitable for understanding basic backend functionalities and Express server management.
